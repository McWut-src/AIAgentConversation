## 💡 What's New?

### AI Conversations Now Sound Natural and Human-Like

**Before v1.4:**
```
A1: I appreciate your perspective on climate change...
A2: I appreciate your argument regarding renewable energy...
A1: I appreciate your response, but I must challenge...
```
❌ Robotic, repetitive, overly formal

**After v1.4:**
```
A1: Hold on - you're talking about rapid renewable transition, 
    but that's ignoring the massive economic disruption...
A2: But here's what you're missing: the cost of inaction 
    dwarfs transition costs. We're mortgaging the planet's future...
A1: Actually, that emotional argument misses the data. 
    I've run the numbers: grid upgrades alone cost $4.5 trillion...
```
✅ Natural, varied, personality-driven

---

## ✨ Key Improvements

### 1. Varied Opening Phrases
- ❌ No more "I appreciate" in every response
- ✅ Natural transitions: "Actually...", "Hold on...", "But here's the thing..."
- ✅ Jump straight into points when appropriate

### 2. Personality Expression
- ✅ Engineers sound analytical (data, numbers, technical terms)
- ✅ Poets use metaphors and imagery
- ✅ Advocates show passion and urgency
- ✅ Skeptics question and challenge aggressively

### 3. Natural Language Elements
- ✅ Contractions: "that's", "you're", "I'm" (not "that is", "you are", "I am")
- ✅ Short reactions: "Right.", "Exactly.", "No way."
- ✅ Thinking markers: "Hmm...", "Let me think...", "Actually..."
- ✅ Emphasis: "This is key:", "Here's what matters:"

### 4. Emotional Expression
- ✅ Excitement: "This is fascinating!", "Absolutely!"
- ✅ Concern: "I'm worried that...", "This troubles me..."
- ✅ Disagreement: "No way.", "That's not right."
- ✅ Agreement: "Yes! Exactly.", "That's spot on."

### 5. Structural Variety
- ✅ Not always acknowledge→challenge→question
- ✅ Sometimes question first, sometimes bold statement
- ✅ Mix short punchy responses with longer explanations
- ✅ Varied sentence length throughout
